You've heard of the MERN Stack but how about the MERNG Stack? Adding GraphQL to your stack can make interacting with data even simpler.

We've released a course on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel that will teach you how to use MongoDB, Express, Node, React, Node, and GraphQL to create a social media application.

Ahmed from the Classsed YouTube channel developed this course. He has created a bunch of popular software courses that have helped a lot of people.
